 Using a Kaggle Dataset to see if cryptojacked computers can be identified.


# Introduction

Cryptojacking is the hacking of computers and using their processing ability to mine crypto currency. As cryptocurrencies have exploded in value and popularity, cryptojacking has become a major issue in the cybersecurity realm. As I am interested in time series, I was eager to practice my machine learning abilities.


# Past Research

Given my lack of knowledge of computer hardware or cybersecurity, I was indebted to several papers that boosted my understanding of what is going on. I didn't dive too deep as my goal is to merely get a sensical machine learning model running and not necessarily provide the most up-to-date or academic reccomendations for cybersecurity. 

Here are the papers:

'CoinPolice: Detecting Hidden Cryptojacking Attacks with
Neural Networks' https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10861.pdf


# Data Reproduceability

I accessed the data from Kaggle. The original source is undisclosed; however, it comes from information produced by a university, the Informatics Institute of Technology. Here is the link:

It consists of 3 datasets, the normal, the abnormal, and the combined data.
